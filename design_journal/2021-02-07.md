# 2021-02-07: Removed hard-coded host names and domain name

## Overview

The original script was written for my environment. I have removed all of the
dependencies on my environment.

# Design Choices

## Execution Environment

Changed the execution environment from `/bin/bash` to `/usr/bin/env bash` in
order to make the script more portable across modern Linux environments.

## Get Domain Name

Instead of hard-coding the domain name as `yaocm.id.au`, I try to get the
domain name from one of the following sources:

1. `hostname --domain`
1. The fully-qualified hostname with the word before the first '.' stripped
away. That is, `coogee.yaocm.id.au` becomes `yaocm.id.au` as required.

This change should make this script more portable across different domains.

However, this script cannot mount across multiple domains. All of the remote
hosts must be in the same domain.

## Find Host Names to Mount

Instead of reading from a list of host names in a string, I now look at all
directories under `~/mount` (only one level deep).

This means that the simple host name is extracted from the directory name. The
remote host name is a concatenation of this simple name with the domain name.
