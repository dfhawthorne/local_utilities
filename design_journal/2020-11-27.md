playbooks after changes have been made.

Design
======

Purpose
-------

Instead of remembering to type in three (3) different commands to ensure that
there were no simple mistakes in an
[Ansible playbook](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/playbooks_intro.html),
I want a simple utility to do this consistently. (One (1) command is repeated
with different parameters.)

Name of Script
--------------

I choose `ansible-check.sh` as the name of the script because it mimics the
general structure of other Ansible commands. The `.sh` suffix indicates that
this is a shell script. No other names were considered.

Commands Chosen
---------------

I chose the following commands to be run in the following order:
1. [yamllint](https://github.com/adrienverge/yamllint)
1. [ansible-playbook](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/cli/ansible-playbook.html)
doing a syntax check
1. [ansible-lint](https://ansible-lint.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)
1. [ansible-playbook](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/cli/ansible-playbook.html)
running in check mode.

This is in order of increasing complexity.

[yamllint](https://github.com/adrienverge/yamllint) captures YAML errors and
style issues. This is the simplest check.

In syntax check mode,
[ansible-playbook](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/cli/ansible-playbook.html)
major syntax errors are caught.

[ansible-lint](https://ansible-lint.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)
captures style issues such as missing optional parameters.

In check mode,
[ansible-playbook](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/cli/ansible-playbook.html)
runs the playbook without making any changes.

Error Handling
--------------

I do simple parameter checking, only checking for a passed parameter.

If any command fails, the script simply exits. I rely on the failing command to
produce the error messages.
