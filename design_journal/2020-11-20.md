2020-11-20 SSHFS Design
=======================

Overview
--------

I have now decided to disable GUI on most of my test VM images in order to save
on memory usage. I am using SSHFS to mount remote home directories without the
administrative overhead of either NFS or AUTOFS.

AUTOFS will stil be used for software installations because the remote
directories are on a NAS.

Design Decisions
================

Name of Script
--------------

I chose `mount_over_ssh.sh` because it is a simple functional description. No
alternatives were considered.

Script Location
---------------

The __local\_utilities__ repository was chosen because this is a general script
that does not relate to any specific project.

Directory Structure
-------------------

I chose to locate the mount points within `~/mount` because that is most easily
accessible by me, and the name is suggestive enough.

The subdirectories are all based on the short host name because all of my mounts
are within the same domain.
