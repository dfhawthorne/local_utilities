# Design Decisions

## Addition of Optional Parameter

I have an issue with a dodgy DNS name server. It responds to direct requests,
but not to implicit searches. It was easier to add a parameter than to resolve
the DNS lookup issue.

## Choice of Name

I chose `-n` as the name of the parameter for name server. It seemed to be the
obvious choice.

# Extra Functionality

## Error Handling

I now check for the existence of the following commands:

- `dig`
- `findmnt`
- `sshfs`

The absence of either of the last two (2) commands causes the utility to fail.
The absence of the first command avoids the DNS name lookup either implicitly
or through the passed name server parameter.
