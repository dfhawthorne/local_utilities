===================================

Overview
--------

Added identity of failing host to error message and made the sshfs mount script
(`mount_over_ssh.sh`) idempotent.

Problem Description
===================

There are two (2) problems with my original implementation of
`mount_over_ssh.sh`:
1. No identification of which host caused the error message
2. The script is not idempotent as it tries to remount the same connection

Solution Design
===============

Detection of Existing Mounts
----------------------------

I found three (3) ways:
1. Search the output of the `mount -l` command. But the man page discourages
this and says to use `findmnt` instead.
1. Search the contents of `/proc/mounts` using `grep`
3. Use `findmnt`

So, the choice is between options 2 and 3. The timing tests reveal that option 3 is faster:
```bash
douglas@coogee:~$ time grep --no-messages --silent "auburn.yaocm.id.au:/home/douglas" /proc/mounts

real    0m0.027s
user    0m0.003s
sys     0m0.000s
douglas@coogee:~$ time findmnt mount/auburn >/dev/null

real    0m0.006s
user    0m0.005s
sys     0m0.000s
```
