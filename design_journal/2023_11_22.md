# 2023-11-22: Show Status of All Local GIT Repositories

## Summary

I needed a script to display the status of all of my GIT repositories.

## Design

The script is called `git-status.sh` and is based on `git-synch.sh`.

The name is modelled after the GIT command used.

Because of the possibility of the amount of data returned, I have opted for the short form across all branches in the GIT repository.
