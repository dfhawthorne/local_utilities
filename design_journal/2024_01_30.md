# 2024-01-30: Counting Lines of Code (LOC) in GIT Repositories

I have created a Bash script, `count_loc.sh`, to count non-blank lines of code (LOC) in downloaded GIT repositories in the `git-repositories` directory.

Languages are classified by file name suffices. I tried to use the `file` command, but found the command to be unreliable in classifying languages. I retain the use of the `file` command to detect compiled programs.

The languages classified as follows:

| Languages | Suffices |
| --- | --- |
| Assembler | `.s` |
| Bash | `.sh`, `.sj.j2` (These are double counted) |
| C | `.c`, `.c.inc`, `.h` |
| Jinja2 | `.j2` (These are double counted) |
| Latex | `.tex`, `.bibtex` |
| Makefile | `Makefile` |
| Markdown | `.md` |
| Python | `.py`, `.py.j2` (These are double counted) |
| R | `.Rmd` |
| SED | `.sed` |
| SQL | `.sql`, `.sql.j2` (These are double counted) |
| TCL | `.tcl`, `.tcl.j2`, `.tcl.inc` |
| Terraform | `.tf` |
| TLA+ | `.tla` |
| YAML | `.yml` |

__Note__: Jinja2 files are double counted both as Jinja2 and the language of the generated file. This is __intentional__.

There are two (2) outputs:

1. `STDOUT` produces a CSV format
2. `STDERR` lists all files that are classified as _Other_.

Invocation of this script is done as follows:

```bash
cd ~/git-repositories/local_utilities
./count_loc.sh >~/Documents/LOC.csv 2>/tmp/LOC.err
```
